# thesis-visualization
This repository contains the dynamic versions of the graphs and charts found in my thesis. I threw in a couple of extra graphs just for you.

I used BERTopic to perform topic modeling on my corpora for my thesis. I was most interested in extracting topics and their similarity, as well as how often they appeared in my corpora over time. While doing this, I was able to generate some additional visualizations. Though not directly relevant to my work, I thought that they were still notable enough to share. So, if you're curious, come take a look.

If you have any questions, feel free to contact me.
